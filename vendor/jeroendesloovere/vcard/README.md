> This VCard PHP class can generate a vCard version 4.0. .vcf file with one or more vCards in it. Parsing is also possible. OOP is our goal-focus, so every property has its own class.

Documentation about vCard 4.0:
* [vCard 4.0 specification: RFC6350](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350)
* [vCard 4.0 versus vCard 3.0](https://devguide.calconnect.org/vCard/vcard-4/)

## Installation

```bash
composer require jeroendesloovere/vcard:dev-2.0.0-dev
```
> This will install the 2.0 WIP development version of vcard with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

$lastname = "Berg";
$firstname = "Melroy";
$additional = "van den";
$prefix = "Mr.";
$suffix = "";

$vcard = new VCard();
$vcard->add(new Name($lastname, $firstname, $additional, $prefix, $suffix));

$formatter = new Formatter(new VcfFormatter(), 'vcard-export');
$formatter->addVCard($vcard);
