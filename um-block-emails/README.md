## Ultimate Member - Block Disposable Email Domains

This provides a list of known Spam/Disposable Email Domains.

Once activated, this will update the list of blocked email domains in Ultimate Member > Settings > Access > Other > Blocked Disposable Email Domains.
This updates the list daily if there's a new disposable email domain to block. This merges with Blocked Emails option so you can add your Email address and Domains using the existing option.
